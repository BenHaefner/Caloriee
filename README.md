# Caloriee

Caloriee is a Calorie tracking app written in SwiftUi. It uses both data from the USDA, as well as AI to help users estimate calories in any given food item. It is a project I started to both learn SwiftUi as well as to play around with new iOS features at the time like Liquid Glass and Apple's Foundation Models.
